# TidyBee Front-End

The **tidybee-front** project represents the front-end component of the TidyBee tool. TidyBee is designed as a solution for analyzing shared spaces, providing visibility into dysfunctions within an organization. The tool allows users to define custom criteria for evaluating these shared spaces. Using a rating system based on these criteria, end-users can make changes to files to create a perfect harmony.

TidyBee is divided into three sub-projects: **tidybee-backend**, **tidybee-front**, and **tidybee-hub**.
